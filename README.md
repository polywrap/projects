# Polywrap Projects
A place for our community to create & track in-progress projects.

## Motivation
The goal of this system is to increase our ability to coordinate & make decisions at scale. It does this by addressing the following pain points:  
* Unclear what projects are being worked on.
* Unclear on how different projects interconnect.
* Lack of project planning, feedback, and retrospectives.
* Projects should align with the group's values, mission, and vision.
* Stand-ups are tedious, and don't provide a great macro-level view.

## Principles
Projects that are accepted into this repo should follow these overarching principles:  
- **Focus:** Focused on a clear set of initiatives.
- **Measurable:** Progress should be easily measurable.
- **Imactful:** The "audience" who will be impacted is clearly understood and valued.
- **Leadership:** Lead by 1 or more identifiable individuals. Leadership should have a proven track record, increase trust with the community at large.
- **Informative:** Any curious community member should be able to inform themselves on the details of a project. Information can be disseminated using any medium, and should be clearly defined within the project's document.
- **Ephemeral:** Projects should not turn into "Organizational Silos". Instead, projects should last for a pre-defined duration of time. 2-3 months should be used as a maximum timeframe, and if more time is needed come term-end, a new "chapter" of the same project can be proposed.

## Process
### Activation
1. **Create:**
    * Create a new git branch.
        * ex: `new-project-init`
    * Duplicate & rename the `./in-progress/TEMPLATE.md` document.
        * ex: `new-project.md`
    * Complete all sections within the project document.
2. **Propose:**
    * Create a new pull-request, merging the project branch into the `main` branch.
        * ex: `new-project-init` -> `main`
    * Share & pitch your project to the rest of the community, gain their support!
        * ex: discuss during a group chat or call
3. **Activate:**
    * Project will be "activated" when their pull-request gains approval, such that it can be merged into the `main` branch.
    * Feedback can be shared in any fashion, but ultimately the pull-request will serve as the source of truth.

### In Progress

## Example Scenario

### In Progress
- Jill gains approval, she is the leader and works with 2 others on the "foo" project
- As they make progress, updates are clearly viewable at the "progress" link posted in the project spec
    - Clair wants to know what the status of "foo" is, so she looks at the "progress" link in her own time, sees that good progress is being made.
- Mid-point checkpoint meeting is conducted
    - Clair expresses her views on the project
    - Bill shares some feedback
- During DAO-wide meetings (ex: ACDC), status updates can be provided
- draft PR w/ updates

### Completed
- Jill determines the work is completed
- Jill creates a PR with her completed updates, marking the project as finished
    - async: Clair & Bill both respond on the PR with their approval
- Demo is required to complete the submission.
    - In-Meeting or async demos can both work
    - A recording should be made
- In the PR
    - readiness checklist w/ 3rd party approval
    - demo recording
- Final: PR approved (2 signers)
