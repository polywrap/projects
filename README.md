# Polywrap Projects
## Description
TODO

## Motivation
- Pain points
    1. Unclear what different projects we are working on
    2. Stand-up channel is not working for the team, need to think of new ideas around it
    3. Missing project planning and retro aspects
    4. Unclear on how different projects interconnect 
    5. Missing mission & vision
    6. Missing team/DAO values

## Principles
- **Focus:** WGs should be focused on clear initiatives.
- **Leadership:** WGs should be lead by 1 or more clearly identified individuals. Leadership should be emergent based on the initiative at hand, with a proven track record to increase trust w/ the DAO at large.
- **Measurable:** WGs progress should be easily measurable.
- **Imactful:** Clearly defined "audience" who will be impacted by the results of this project.
- **Ephemeral:** WGs should not turn into "Organizational Silos", which have been documented to be detrimental to organizations at large. Instead, WGs should be ephemeral and last for a duration of time. I propose 2-3 months as a maximum, and if more time is needed come term-end, a new "season" of the same WG can be proposed.
- **Informative:** The WG should be "informative" for any curious DAO member. This can be done through any medium, but it should be clearly defined in the WG's definition. For example, the following sources of information could be used: `GitHub Repo/Branch`, `Weekly Status Update`, `Discord Channel`, etc.

## Example User Journey
### New Project (Creation -> Activation -> In Progress -> Completed)
- Jill has an idea for a new project
    - Jill shares the idea with the group
        - Option A: At a call
        - Option B: In the chat

https://github.com/polywrap/projects

### Creation
- Contributor Jill has an idea for a new project "foo"
    - forks the TEMPLATE project spec
    - drafts the "foo" project spec
    - creates a new Pull Request
        - signal to the group at large that she'd like to "launch" this new project

### Activation
- The DAO forms consensus around the new "foo" project
    - Option 1: async
        - PR: Contributor Jordan likes the idea, and comments on the PR in support + adds one approval
        - Discord: Contributor Phil likes the idea, sends comments in discord saying so
    - Option 2: call
        - Pitch: Jill pitches to the DAO her project, receives feedback, gains general approval
    - Final: PR approved (2 signers)

### In Progress
- Jill gains approval, she is the leader and works with 2 others on the "foo" project
- As they make progress, updates are clearly viewable at the "progress" link posted in the project spec
    - Clair wants to know what the status of "foo" is, so she looks at the "progress" link in her own time, sees that good progress is being made.
- Mid-point checkpoint meeting is conducted
    - Clair expresses her views on the project
    - Bill shares some feedback
- During DAO-wide meetings (ex: ACDC), status updates can be provided

### Completed
- Jill determines the work is completed
- Jill creates a PR with her completed updates, marking the project as finished
    - async: Clair & Bill both respond on the PR with their approval
- Demo is required to complete the submission.
    - In-Meeting or async demos can both work
    - A recording should be made
- In the PR
    - readiness checklist w/ 3rd party approval
    - demo recording
- Final: PR approved (2 signers)
