# Polywrap Projects
A place for our community to create & track in-progress projects.

## Motivation
The goal of this repository is to increase our ability to coordinate & make decisions at scale. It does this by addressing the following pain points:  
* Unclear what projects are being worked on.
* Unclear how different projects interconnect.
* Lack of project planning, feedback, and retrospectives.
* Projects should align with the community's values, mission, and vision.

## Principles
Projects accepted into this repo should follow these overarching principles:  
- **Focus:** Focused on a clear set of initiatives.
- **Measurable:** Progress should be easily measurable.
- **Imactful:** The "audience" who will be impacted is clearly understood and valued.
- **Leadership:** Lead by 1 or more identifiable individuals. Leadership should have a proven track record, increase trust with the community at large.
- **Informative:** Any curious community member should be able to inform themselves on the details of a project. Information can be disseminated using any medium, and should be clearly defined within the project's document.
- **Ephemeral:** Projects should not turn into "Organizational Silos". Instead, projects should last for a pre-defined duration of time. 2-3 months should be used as a maximum timeframe, and if more time is needed come term-end, a new "chapter" of the same project can be proposed.

## Process
### Create a new project...
1. **Create:**
    * Create a new git branch. (ex: `new-project-init`)
    * Duplicate & rename the `./in-progress/TEMPLATE.md` document. (ex: `./in-progress/new-project.md`)
    * Fill out all sections within the project document.
2. **Propose:**
    * Create a new pull-request, merging the project branch into the `main` branch. (ex: `new-project-init` -> `main`)
    * Share & pitch your project to the rest of the community, gain their support! (ex: discuss within a group chat or call)
3. **Activate:**
    * Project will be "activated" when their pull-request gains approval, such that it can be merged into the `main` branch.
    * Feedback can be shared in any fashion, but ultimately the pull-request will serve as the source of truth.

### Work on a project...
4. **Execute:**
    * Working towards completing your project's goals!
5. **Share:**
    * Share information with community members. This can be done in many ways, in either a "push" or "pull" fashion.
6. **Midpoint Check-In:**
    * Conduct a check-in meeting with interested community members at the midpoint of the project (i.e. half complete).

### Complete a project...
7. **Submit:**
    * Create a new git branch. (ex: `new-project-submit`)
    * Move your project document into the `./completed` folder. (ex: `./completed/new-project.md`)
    * Fill out the document's "submission" section.
    * Create a new pull-request, merging the project branch into the `main` branch. (ex: `new-project-submit` -> `main`)
8. **Demo & Retro:**
    * Demos & retrospectives are required for submission.
    * These can be done offline or live over a call, but must be recorded.
    * Recording will be linked in the project document.
9. **Acceptance:**
    * Project will be "completed" when the pull-request gains approval, such that it can be merged into the `main` branch.
    * Feedback can be shared in any fashion.
