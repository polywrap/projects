# Documentation V2
## Goals

[HackMD detailing Docs V2 outline](https://hackmd.io/qiDX0EX8SnqJE-Q9mGJOcQ)

- Complete Step 1 & Step 2 of the HackMD outline
- Clean up Guides per Step 3 specification

### Tasks

- Come up with clear way to organize the Concepts section that focuses on ease of introduction to the underlying WRAP protocol, and the Polywrap toolchain.
  - **NOTE:** - I'd say the most important part of this would be the Client and Invoke, as it has the most immediate impact
- Comb through the existing Concepts section
  - Ensure it's "dry, high-level stuff"
- Ensure that we have a clear, copy-pasteable "Get Started" section for:
  - JS Client (use Polywrap within your own project)
  - Toolchain (build your own wrapper)
  - **NOTE:** These should link to the appropriate Concepts sections as often as possible.

**Bonus goals**
- Update Doc website styles to align with the Polywrap website redesign
  - This can be as simple as a stylesheet update!

## Non-Goals

- Adding new guides should not be part of this Project
  - We want to keep the scope of the Project manageable and predictable
- Project version support
  - We have multiple projects/packages, each with their own version. Need to find a way to support this neatly

## Duration

The Project would ideally take 1 month to complete. It's suggested to set the duration of the Project to 2 months to accomodate for unknowns.

## Leadership & Contributors

[@pileks](https://github.com/pileks) is a member of the Polywrap DAO and would be the person responsible for the completion of the Project.

It would be extremely helpful that other members provide their input in regards to various points of the Concepts section in order to make the documentation as clear as possible.

Other Contributors involved so far:
  - [@krisbitney](https://github.com/krisbitney) - Wrote documentation on various elements of the Polywrap Toolchain, helped in development efforts of supporting tools
  - [@dorgjelli](https://github.com/dorgjelli) - Provided feedback on tooling developed so far, and assisted in creating the original tooling.

**Potential further involvement:**
  - [@kev-ngo](https://github.com/kev-ngo) - Facilitate alignment of the Docs website design with the rebranding of Polywrap's main webpage

## Context

As we are working on the rebranding of our webpage, we also want to streamline our Docs in accordance with the plan we outlined for them.

Essentially, this is a formalization of the ongoing work on the Docs, now with bonus timeframe.

## Impact

Our new webpage will certainly garner visitors, with developers being the main target group.

The changes to our Docs will hopefully allow us to retain more developers who express an interest in Polywrap by providing them with well thought-out, quality documentation which will bootstrap them to develop using Polywrap.

This will be especially important if we want to run mini-hacks and sponsor hackathon events, as good documentation will be a prerequisite for the usage of Polywrap in time-constrained efforts.

## Progress Updates
