- Ideas to address the pain points
    1. Each new project should have a kick-off/planning meeting and once launched have a retro meeting to reflect on the project
    2. Have pitch slots where folks can share new project ideas and seek guidance, feedback & interest from everyone
    3. Have project demo slots where folks can demo a completed project so everyone knows what exactly was built
    4. TBD on how to get status updates in a fun and engaging way
    5. With branding we will work on mission, vision & values
- Proposed Flow:
    1. Planning
        1. Pitch new projects using pitch slot
    2. Building
        1. Once the pitched project is sponsored, schedule panning/kick-off meeting
        2. Share weekly status with the team on the progress of the project
        3. Once completed, demo the project to the team for any last moment feedback 
        4. Meet the criteria of 
            
            [Product Readiness Checklist](https://www.notion.so/Product-Readiness-Checklist-4f08bec62475494d86c34ddb07c8f041)
            
        5. Launch/deploy to prod
    3. After Launch
        1. For wrappers/plugins
            
            [Wrapper Support](https://www.notion.so/Wrapper-Support-143ca3e1188142bd8084b47c18f7e9b1)
            
        2. For other enhancements, share the project with our community

**Note: The mission, vision & values will be the compass guiding us in making decisions**

## Meetings

- Pain points
    1. Unclear what’s the goal of the meeting
    2. Unclear who will be joining the meeting
    3. Unclear what will be discussed in the meeting (agenda)
    4. Hard to find availability of the team since it’s not centralized (need to check Cal link of each person or find their Cal usernames and concatenate them)
    5. On Discord hard to tell when who is talking when you’re sharing the screen
    6. Difficult to record meetings
- Ideas to address the pain points
    1. Use google calendar & google meets
        1. Host of the meeting should add agenda, goal and helpful resources/links to the meeting invite description
        2. Everyone should respond to the meeting invites (yes, no/maybe with reason) so it’s clear if the meeting needs to be moved or can happen
        3. Keep google calendar updated with your working hours and no-schedule/focus time slots
        4. Bonus: Consider turning on camera whenever possible to feel connected to the team :)
