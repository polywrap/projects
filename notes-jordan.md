# PIP: Working Group Model (Projects?)

ideas (product, feedback, devs, etc)
- mission & vision
-> roadmap (how long, resources, timeline)
  -> project(s) within


# Open Question
- Who should be signers that can approve projects?
- What should our initial set of working groups be?

## Feedback
- possible WGs: wrappers.io, native client, etc
- Need to be careful, still small, need to continue to work closely together.
- Should increase coworking (pair programming, etc).
- Should be able to spin them up spontaneously
    - native client
    - HTTP interface
    - reimagined
    - ABI 0.2
    - wrappers.io
    - wrapper development
- possible setup: discord channel for WGs, github project(s)?
- no "structure for the sake of structure"
- should think about starting them from the roadmap
    - would also like to separate WGs from roadmap
- differentiation between WGs & Pods?
- WGs should be a more formal thing of doing things that we have been doing so far
    - coordinate, cowork, cocreate, publish, etc
- should reduce information surface area
- Should know "what WGs are active right now".
- WGs can give quick overview of what went on. Need to be concise.
- ACDC is still very useful. Could have WGs give overview in first couple of minutes of the ACDC.
- WGs will help unload niche specific topics & conversations out of the ACDC. The ACDC will still have top-level / general topics, that we will want to still discuss together.
- should have better "hard caps" on ACDC sharing time, everything else can be moved to WG chat (async or sync).
- ACDC agenda can be crafted 1 day before, instead of on-demand.
- Should be as light-weight as possible, benefit those making the logs as much as those viewing it.
- Should be able to post notes / meeting notes so others can easily see what has been done.
- Should be able to see information about meetings that are taking place (if any)
- main purpose is to make the doings of different subgroups within the DAO as easy to understand as possible (alternative to standups)

## V1
- repo
- README
    - what
    - why
    - how
- template WG doc that can be forked
- create a discord channel to kick this off
    - public?
    - GH notifs


## Motivation
- What is being built
- Things are being talked about in an ad-hoc way
- unclear on different projects we're working on
- unclear mission & vision of different projects
- What are lego pieces that can be built ontop of eachother
